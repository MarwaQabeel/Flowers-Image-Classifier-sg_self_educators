## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python, PyTorch and PIL.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.\*, PyTorch, PIL.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is from Udacity's image classification project. It trains CNN model to classify picturesof flowers.

## Files Description<a name="files"></a>


**cat_to_name.json** It is used in ipynb and py file to map flower number to flower names.

 - **Methodology**



## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Udacity for the project. You can't use this for your Udacity deep learning project. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
